- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first computer program was written by a woman named Ada Lovelace in the mid-1800s? She wrote the algorithm for Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, which is considered to be the first computer program in history. Her work laid the foundation for modern computing and she is often referred to as the world's first computer programmer.
